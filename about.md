My name is Damian Hamill and I enjoy working with Ruby and Javascript and solving challenging tech problems.
I am a former CTO of a UK tech startup (that failed *sigh*) and I have been cutting code since 1990.  Before becoming a CTO I was Technical Director of an ISP in the UK at the beginning of the Internet's dramatic rise in popularity.  I also instigated the creation of the UK's Internet service Providers Association.

Developing the ISP service provided an opportunity to develop some interesting technology.  In the days of Dialup modems I implemented the worlds first dynamic DNS system to support SMTP email to dialup clients and I implemented a system to insert unobtrusive text advertising into email bound for users of our free dialup service.

If only I had realised at the time advertising would become the backbone of the Internet revenue model!!!

<h2>Purpose</h2>

When not under contract I spend most of my free time exploring new technologies and frameworks and working on my own startup projects.  When not at the computer I enjoy messing about with my boat.
I hope that whatever I write here will be useful to you.
